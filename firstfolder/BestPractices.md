# **Project Management Best Practices**  

## **1. Project Plan & Documentation**  
- Maintain a **Project Roadmap** outlining key **milestones (World, AI bots, Tokens) deliverables, and deadlines.**  
- Use GitHub **Wikis** or a `project-plan.md` file to store:  
  - Project Roadmap (link)  
  - Kanban Boards (link)  
  - Other docs (link)

## **2. Kanban Board Usage**  
- **Use GitHub Projects (Kanban Board) for task tracking.**  
- Structure the board into **7 columns**:  
  1. **Plan** – Define high-level tasks and objectives.  
  2. **Prototype** – Work on proof-of-concepts or experimental features.  
  3. **Test** – Identify issues and validate assumptions before full development.  
  4. **Design** – UI/UX wireframing, animations, and experience improvements.  
  5. **Develop** – Active coding and implementation.  
  6. **Test/Bug Fix** – Debugging and quality assurance.  
  7. **Deploy** – Pushing features to production.  

## **3. Task Management & Assignments**  
- **Every task should have a clear owner and due date.**  
- Use **labels and milestones** to categorize tasks (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `high-priority`).  
- Prioritize urgent issues (e.g., bugs affecting gameplay).  

## **4. Sprint Planning & Reviews**  
- Plan **weekly or bi-weekly sprints** with clear objectives.  
- Conduct **Sprint Reviews** to assess progress.  

## **5. Continuous Improvement**  
- Regularly **review and refine workflows** based on team feedback.  
- Use **retrospectives** to identify what’s working and what needs improvement.  

## **6. Automation & Monitoring**  
- **Set up webhooks** to monitor commits, pull requests, and deployments.  
- **Integrate CI/CD pipelines** to automate testing and deployment.  

## **7. Access Management & Permissions**  
- **Create teams and define access levels:**  
  - **General Team:** Access to shared cross-world implementations.  
  - **Specific World Teams:** Limited access to particular worlds they are assigned to.  
- **Use GitHub role-based permissions** to restrict access based on responsibilities.  


## **8. Repository Structure & Organization**  
- **Follow main [Magic World](https://github.com/MeetYourAI/MagicWorlds/tree/main) repo structure  
- **Use README files** in each doc folder of the subworld repo to document purpose, setup instructions, and guidelines.  

## **9. Code Review & Collaboration**  (suggestions for [Contributing](https://github.com/MeetYourAI/MagicWorlds/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md))
- **Use pull requests (PRs) for all changes.**  
  - Require at least one reviewer for approvals.  
  - Run automated tests before merging.  
- **Follow commit message best practices:**  
  - ✅ `feat: add AI bot interaction for Finance World`  
  - ✅ `fix: resolve leaderboard display issue`  
  - ❌ `Update stuff` (Avoid vague messages)
